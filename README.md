Introduction to analysis of Solar images and differential rotation in Python (Exeter Scholars workshop)

Download the Jupyter notebooks and the image files to work with on your PC.

There are two notebooks: one is for the main afternoon session ("Intro to solar..."); the other ("whirlwind tour...") is for the morning.  The latter is intended for people with zero previous familiarity with Python.

For the curious: the images in the Solar notebook are derived from data from the Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI) aboard the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO).  This is what the Sun looked like on August 12, 2024.  (Note that I have cheated a little bit, to keep this demo fairly simple; for example, the data really ought to be rotated, and we have made no effort to calibrate the intensity values in the "Dopplergram" to actual velocity values.)
